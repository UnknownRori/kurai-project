### About Touhou Project

Touhou Project is an indie game series (also known as "doujin" in Japanese)
known for its ensemble cast of characters and memorable soundtracks.
It is produced by and large by a single artist known as ZUN, and has a
[permissive license](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki:Copyrights#Copyright_status.2FTerms_of_Use_of_the_Touhou_Project>)
which allows for indie derivative works such as Kurai Project to legally exist.

Kurai Project is *not* a "clone" of Touhou Project, and tells an original story with its own
music, art, gameplay mechanics, and codebase. While some familiarity with Touhou
is helpful, the gameplay can be enjoyed on its own without prior knowledge of
the series.
